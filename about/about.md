  Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on adding more content, in the form of additional projects, a blog, and a home page revamp. So there's more to look forward to. :)

### Me

Hi, I'm Kulvinder.

I hail from Uttar Pradesh, India. Though, I have spent a couple of the past few years in Punjab, India where I completed a Bachelor of  Technology degree from Lovely Professional University, India's largest private university.

I currently live in Noida, working as a Data Analyst/ Backend Developer at Moglix Pvt. Ltd. 
I use statistics and machine learning to solve our customer's analytics problems, and incorporating predictive models in Unscrambl's flagship product, *Drive*. Being a jack of all trades, I also build front-end applications, dashboards and visualisations to help our customers interact with our data products. You do need good storytelling for good data. ;)


So yeah, I am having my fair share of startup experience, and the usual get sh*t done attitude that comes with it.

I'm also <em>really</em> into music, creative writing, reading and travelling.

Python • R • Ruby • Java • Javascript • AngularJS • HTML • CSS • Bootstrap • NodeJS • Jquery • MySQL • MongoDB • Scikit-Learn • NLTK • Pandas • Numpy

for use with concepts such as:

Thankfully, I'm not a cat.
