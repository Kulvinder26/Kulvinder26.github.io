  Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on adding more content, in the form of additional projects, a blog, and a home page revamp. So there's more to look forward to. :)

### Me

Hi, I'm Kulvinder.

I hail from Uttar Pradesh, India. Though, I have spent a couple of the past few years in Punjab, India where I completed a Bachelor of  Technology degree from Lovely Professional University, India's largest private university.

I currently live in Noida, working as a Business Analyst at Moglix Pvt. Ltd.. I use software development and data analysis to solve our business's analytics problems, and filling the gap between decision makers and the data.
I have worked on two major projects which are still progressing.
* Designed solution for interactively reporting data related to different KPIs online, creating ease for business for taking decisions based on data rapidly.
* Developed a platform where business can access daily updated frequently used reports, helping them to stay current with all the trends at different levels.
So yeah, I am having my fair share of startup experience, and the usual get sh*t done attitude that comes with it.

Apart from this, I also spend time on taking part in 
#### Kaggle competitions 
and building my knowledge about building better predictive models and understanding the data better.
I have been in
##### TOP 5%  
of 
##### Advanced Regression with House Prices Kaggle Competition .



I'm also <em>really</em> into music, creative writing, reading and travelling.
