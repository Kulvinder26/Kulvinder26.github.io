### About Me

Hi, I’m **Kulvinder Singh**, a Senior Backend Engineer based in India.

I have 6+ years of experience building and operating **production-grade backend systems**
using **Python, Django/DRF, Flask**, and cloud-native technologies. My work focuses on
designing scalable APIs, asynchronous systems, and backend platforms that support
real-world business workflows with high reliability.

I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from **Lovely Professional University**
and have since worked in fast-paced product environments where ownership, system quality,
and long-term maintainability matter.

### Professional Experience

I currently work as a **Senior Software Engineer (Backend)**, where I own backend systems
end-to-end — from business logic and database design to API contracts, background processing,
and deployments.

My experience includes:
- Designing and evolving **REST APIs** with backward compatibility
- Building **microservices** and async workflows using queues and background jobs
- Working with **databases and caching layers** (MySQL, Redis, MongoDB)
- Improving system reliability, maintainability, and operational efficiency
- Collaborating closely with product, frontend, and business teams

Previously, I have worked on backend services, data pipelines, and CI/CD systems
supporting large internal and business-facing platforms.
