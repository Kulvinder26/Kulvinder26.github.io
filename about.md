  Feel free to check our other parts of the website, too! I'm currently working on adding more content, in the form of additional projects, a blog, and a home page revamp. So there's more to look forward to. :)

### Me

Hi, I'm Kulvinder.

I hail from Uttar Pradesh, India. Though, I have spent a couple of the past few years in Punjab, India where I completed a Bachelor of  Technology degree from Lovely Professional University, India's largest private university.

I currently live in Noida, working as a Data Analyst/ Backend Developer at Moglix Pvt. Ltd. and I use software development and data analysis to solve our bussiness's analytics problems, and filling the gap between decision makers and the data*Drive*.
I have worked on two major projects which are still progressing as  per the need of bussiness.
First is self serve data extraction system for interactively accessing data related to different KPIs online, creating
ease for business for taking decisions based on data rapidly.
Second is an online platform where business can access daily updated frequently used reports.
So yeah, I am having my fair share of startup experience, and the usual get sh*t done attitude that comes with it.

Apart from this, I also spend time on taking part in #####Kaggle competitions##### and building my knowledge about building better predictive models and understanding the data better.
I have been in ####TOP 5%#### of ####Advanced Regression with House Prices Kaggle Competition####.



I'm also <em>really</em> into music, creative writing, reading and travelling.

Python • Scikit-Learn • Pandas • Numpy • Keras • Tensorflow • NLTK • SQL • OpenCV • Matplotlib 

for use with concepts such as:
